# Nano Wallet Company Code of Conduct

Nano Wallet Company strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin, body size, race, or religion. As a result, we have agreed to and abide by this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of our open source software.

### Summary

Harassment in code or discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in Nano Wallet Company codebases, issue trackers, Slack, Discord, mailing lists, meetups, and other events. Violators will be warned and then blocked or banned at or before the 3rd violation.

### In detail

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to Github support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us at [info@nanowalletco.com](mailto:info@nanowalletco.com) immediately.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the Nano Wallet Company’s codebases, issue trackers, Discord channel, Slack channel, group chat, and mailing lists.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is actively representing the project or its community. Due to their strong association with the project, core contributors are always seen as actively representing it.

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.
